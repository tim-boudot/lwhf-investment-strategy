    "\n",
    "Day: The day of the month, extracted from the Date column.\n",
    "Daily Variation: The difference between the High and Low columns, divided by the Open column. This feature represents the volatility of the index on that day.\n",
    "TimeStamp: The number of seconds elapsed since January 1st, 1970 00:00:00 UTC, calculated from the Date column. This feature represents the temporal order of the observations.\n",
    "Index Hash: A numerical representation of the Index column, obtained by applying a hash function. This feature encodes the identity of each index in a compact and unique way.\n",
    "Daily Return: The percentage change in the Close column from the previous day’s Close column. This feature represents the performance of the index on that day.\n",
    "7-Day SMA: The 7-day simple moving average of the Close column. This feature represents the short-term trend of the index.\n",
    "7-Day STD: The 7-day standard deviation of the Close column. This feature represents the short-term variability of the index.\n",
    "SMA + 2 STD: The 7-day SMA plus two times the 7-day STD. This feature represents the upper bound of a confidence interval for the index.\n",
    "SMA — 2 STD: The 7-day SMA minus two times the 7-day STD. This feature represents the lower bound of a confidence interval for the index.\n",
    "High — Close: The difference between the High and Close columns, divided by the Open column. This feature represents the downward pressure on the index on that day.\n",
    "Low — Open: The difference between the Low and Open columns, divided by the Open column. This feature represents the upward pressure on the index on that day.\n",
    "Cumulative Return: The cumulative percentage change in the Close column from the first observation in the training set. This feature represents the long-term performance of the index.\n",
    "14-Day EMA: The 14-day exponential moving average of the Close column. This feature represents a smoother and more responsive version of the SMA.\n",
    "Close % Change: The percentage change in the Close column from the previous day’s Close column. This feature is similar to Daily Return, but without scaling by 100.\n",
    "Close Change: The difference between the Close and previous day’s Close columns. This feature is similar to Daily Return, but without dividing by previous day’s Close column.\n",
    "RSI: The relative strength index, calculated from a 14-day window of Close % Change. This feature is a popular technical indicator that measures the momentum and overbought/oversold conditions of an asset.\n",
    "MACD: The moving average convergence divergence, calculated from a 12-day EMA and a 26-day EMA of Close % Change. This feature is another popular technical indicator that measures the trend and momentum of an asset.\n",
    "Stochastic Oscillator: A technical indicator that compares the Close column with the High and Low columns over a 14-day window. This feature measures the position of the index relative to its recent range.\n",
    "ATR: The average true range, calculated from a 14-day window of Daily Variation. This feature measures the volatility of the index over time.\n",
    "ADX: The average directional index, calculated from a 14-day window of High, Low, and Close columns. This feature measures the strength and direction of the trend of the index.\n",
    "DMI: The directional movement index, calculated from a 14-day window of High, Low, and Close columns. This feature measures the positive and negative movements of the index.\n",
